/**
 * The Recorder class provides a framework for recording frames to a file. It includes methods to
 * start and stop the recording process, and an abstract method saveFrame() that must be implemented
 * by subclasses to define the specific behavior for saving a frame.
 *
 * <p>This class is intended to be extended by other classes that provide concrete implementations
 * for saving frames in different formats.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyRecorder extends Recorder {
 *     public MyRecorder(String path, String ext) {
 *         super(path, ext);
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void saveFrame() {
 *         // Implementation for saving a frame
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: The Recorder class uses the Applet class to register a method that is called after each
 * frame is drawn. This ensures that frames are saved at the appropriate time during the recording
 * process.
 *
 * @see Applet
