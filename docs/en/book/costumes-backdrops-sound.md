# Costumes, Backdrops and Sounds

In Scratch you can use the built-in sprite, backdrop and sound libraries. You can also upload you own images or sound files. You can use the built-in editors to modify the files to your liking.

Scratch for Java does not come with any of that. So you have to use external sources and tools to accomplish what Scratch is providing.

## Costumes and Backdrops

You can search the following sources for free graphics, which you can use for costumes or backdrop.
